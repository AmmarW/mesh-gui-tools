## HeatStack Project

### Description

HeatStack is a thermal simulation tool designed to analyze heat transfer in complex systems. It supports features such as:

- Thermal simulation for steady-state and transient conditions.
- Material property customization.
- Visualization of temperature distribution.

For more details, refer to the [HeatStack README](./HeatStack/README.md).

## MeshX Project

### Description

MeshX is a mesh processing tool that provides advanced capabilities for handling and manipulating 3D meshes. It supports:

- Surface mesh import/export handling.
- Mesh validation and transformations (translation, rotation, scaling).
- Boolean operations (union, intersection, difference).
- Volume mesh generation.
- A graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use.

For more details, refer to the [MeshX README](./MeshX/README.md).
