Add a summary of what the code is doing, and take a look at objparser.cpp for reference

To Dos -
1- Handling of volume mesh, import and parsing -- *** Shivam (Function already present for surface mesh in objparser.cpp)
2- Checking for validation to see if what code is giving is correct or not -- *** Ammar
New code that needs to be added, will be a separate file for them
3- Visualisation either through qt ya techplot - *** Mohini
4- Function for translation, rotation - basically manipulation --- *** Harsh
5 - mesh merging -- *** Jasdeep

This is to be worked in last
6- performance optimisation - run time basicaly, initally add a timer to check the run time
