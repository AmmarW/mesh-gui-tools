Add a summary of what the code is doing, and take a look at objparser.cpp for reference

To Dos -
1- Handling of volume mesh, import and parsing -- *** Shivam (Function already present for surface mesh in objparser.cpp)
2- Checking for validation to see if what code is giving is correct or not, adding meta data such as boundary conditions (Work first on basis of surface mesh code then change it from volume based)  -- *** Ammar
New code that needs to be added, will be a separate file for them
3- Visualisation either through qt ya techplot - *** Mohini ( also take care of which format you need for exported files for the visualisation purpose)
4- Function for translation, rotation - basically manipulation --- *** Harsh
5 - mesh merging -- *** Jasdeep

This is to be worked in last
6- performance optimisation - run time basicaly, initally add a timer to check the run time
